# Data Analysis Report

## Overview of Dataset
The analyzed dataset encompasses a wide array of countries, years, and various quality of life indicators, providing a comprehensive view of global well-being metrics from 2005 to 2023. 

### Summary Statistics
- **Countries**: A total of **165 unique countries** were recorded, with Argentina appearing most frequently (**18 occurrences**).
- **Years**: The dataset spans from **2005 to 2023**, with a **mean year of 2014.76**.
  
#### Key Metrics:
- **Life Ladder** (a subjective measure of well-being): 
  - **Mean**: 5.48
  - **Range**: 1.28 (min) - 8.02 (max)
  - **Standard Deviation**: 1.13, indicating variability in reported well-being across different countries.
  
- **Log GDP per capita**: 
  - **Mean**: 9.40 (approximately equivalent to a GDP per capita of about ***8,300 USD***).
  - **Standard Deviation**: 1.15, indicating significant disparities in economic resources available to populations.

- **Social Support**: 
  - **Mean**: 0.81, suggests that on average, individuals feel a robust support network.

- **Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth**: 
  - **Mean**: 63.40 years, with a minimum of 6.72 years highlighting severe health disparities.

### Missing Values
The dataset exhibits missing values in several key areas:
- **Log GDP per capita**: 28 missing entries
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: 63 missing entries
- **Generosity**: 81 missing entries

This could impact the accuracy of correlations and insights drawn from this data. 

## Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix reveals several insightful relationships:

- **Life Ladder and Log GDP per capita**: Strong positive correlation (**0.78**) indicating higher economic resources are generally associated with improved subjective well-being.
  
- **Life Ladder and Social Support**: Also strong (**0.72**), suggesting communal ties substantially impact perceived life quality.

- **Negative Affect and Perceptions of Corruption**: A moderate positive correlation (**0.27**), indicating that countries with higher corruption perception may witness lower life satisfaction.

### Interesting Insights:
- The relationship between **Freedom to make life choices** and **Life Ladder** is notable (**0.54 correlation**), signifying that individual autonomy can have a substantial effect on life satisfaction. 

- **Generosity's** relatively weak correlation with Life Ladder (**0.18**) suggests that self-reported altruism may not directly translate to perceived individual satisfaction.

## Outliers
The dataset identified **105 outliers**. Outliers can often skew results, particularly in regression analysis; hence further investigation is necessary to ascertain if these points warrant removal or deeper examination.

## Regression Analysis
### Coefficients:
The regression coefficients provide insights into the relationship of each feature with the dependent variable (presumably Life Ladder). Notable coefficients include:
- **Positive affect**: Positive contribution (+0.017) suggests greater positive experiences correlate with higher life satisfaction.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Negative impact (-0.039) indicates that as levels of corruption perception grow, life satisfaction may decrease.

### Intercept
- The regression intercept of **0.27** implies the baseline level of life satisfaction when all other variables are at zero.

### Feature Importance
Examining the feature importance demonstrates:
- **Social Support**: Highest importance (**0.2607**), emphasizing its strong effect on life satisfaction.
- **Log GDP per capita**: Significant contribution as well (**0.0932**), reaffirming economic factors' influence on well-being.

## Clustering
Analysis revealed one cluster label across all data points. This suggests either a high degree of similarity among the countries represented in the dataset or an underlying homogeneity in reported well-being metrics that necessitates further granularity in analysis.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a deep understanding of the multifactorial aspects contributing to life satisfaction across countries. The insights indicate that economic conditions, social support, and levels of perceived corruption are paramount in determining quality of life. Given the detected outliers and missing data, further refinement and exploration are warranted to deepen insights and inform policy. 

To enhance the dataset, future iterations should incorporate geographic data and seek to minimize missing values, potentially improving analytical robustness and actionable insights.
